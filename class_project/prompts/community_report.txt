# Goal
Write a comprehensive assessment report of a community taking on the role of a It appears that you have provided a large block of text containing various course descriptions, evaluations, and other information related to university courses. I'll do my best to help you extract insights or answer specific questions about the content.

However, without a clear question or topic to focus on, it's challenging to provide a concise response. Could you please specify what you'd like me to help with? For example:

1. Summarizing key points from a particular course description?
2. Identifying common themes or trends in the evaluations?
3. Answering specific questions about a particular course or topic?

Please let me know how I can assist you, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response!. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.

# Report Structure
The report should include the following sections:

- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.
- REPORT RATING: 这是一份课程评价的数据集，包含了多门课的信息和学生对这些课程的反馈。以下是关键点：

1. **课程信息**：每个条目提供了课程名称、编号、所属学校等基本信息。
2. **教学内容**：有些课程有描述其主要内容或重点。
3. **评价和反馈**：学生对课程进行了评价，包括他们的感受、学习体验和建议。

对于这些评价，我们可以发现以下一些重要的方面：

* **学生参与度**：一些课程引起了学生的积极反应，如“学生很喜欢”或“互动更有利于掌握知识点”。
* **教学方式**：有的学生提到了新颖和有效的教学模式，例如通过大赛主题来提高大学生科技创新创业能力。
* **课程质量**：有些评价表明了对课程设计和内容的满意度，如“很棒”或“重要通知”。
* **问题和建议**：有的学生提到了课程中存在的问题，如软件功能问题或缺乏记录。

总体而言，这份数据集可以用来评估不同课程的教学效果、学生参与度和学习体验。
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.
    {
        "title": "<report_title>",
        "summary": "<executive_summary>",
        "rating": <threat_severity_rating>,

        "findings": "[{"summary":"<insight_1_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_1_explanation"}, {"summary":"<insight_2_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_2_explanation"}]"
    }

# Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in Chinese.

Example paragraph with references added:
This is a paragraph of the output text [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Claims (2, 5), Relationships (10, 12)]

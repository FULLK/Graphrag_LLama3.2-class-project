-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

text:
�我们一起走进汉语课堂，领略汉语魅力！",,,,,,
"评价：聆听兰霞老师的每堂讲课，感觉如沐春风，让人如痴如醉， 简直是美伦美奂 精彩绝伦， 扣人心弦 韵味无穷 精彩纷呈 文采飞扬 妙趣横生 辞采华美惟妙惟肖 津津有味 绘声绘色 娓娓动听 妙语连珠 行云流水！使人产生无限的敬佩之情！
------------------------
output:
Based on the provided text, I will attempt to extract and format the required information according to the specified output format.

**Step 1: Identify Entities**

From the given text, I have identified the following entities:

* **Person**: None explicitly mentioned
* **Location**: None explicitly mentioned
* **Organization**: None explicitly mentioned

However, there are some phrases that could be considered as entities in a broader context:
* "汉语课堂" (Chinese classroom)
* "兰霞老师" (Teacher Lan Xia)

**Step 2: Identify Relationships**

From the given text, I have identified the following relationships:

* None explicitly mentioned between two entities

However, there are some phrases that could be considered as relationships in a broader context:
* "我们一起走进汉语课堂" (We enter the Chinese classroom together) - This phrase implies a relationship between the speaker and the audience, but it's not clear what type of relationship it is.
* "聆听兰霞老师的每堂讲课" (Listening to Teacher Lan Xia's every lecture) - This phrase implies a relationship between the speaker and Teacher Lan Xia, but it's not clear what type of relationship it is.

**Step 3: Format Output**

Based on the provided output format, I will attempt to create a structured output. However, since there are no explicit entities or relationships mentioned in the text, the output will be empty.

```
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}"汉语课堂"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}"Chinese classroom"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}8)
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}"兰霞老师"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}"Teacher Lan Xia"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}8)

("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}"我们一起走进汉语课堂"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}"We enter the Chinese classroom together"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}8)
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}"聆听兰霞老师的每堂讲课"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}"Listening to Teacher Lan Xia's every lecture"{tuple_delimiter}None{tuple_delimiter}8)

```

Please note that the output is not accurate, as there are no explicit entities or relationships mentioned in the text. The provided output format seems to be designed for a specific type of input data

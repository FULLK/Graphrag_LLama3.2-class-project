{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract entities and claims as per the specified steps.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nThe text contains the following entities:\n\n- organization: **NONE** (no organizations mentioned)\n- person: **NONE** (no persons mentioned)\n- geo: **NONE** (no geographic locations mentioned)\n- event: **NONE** (no events mentioned)\n\nHowever, I notice a mention of \"城会玩\" which can be interpreted as an event or activity. But it's not clear what this refers to.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with the entities**\n\nSince there are no matching entities for the specified types, I will look for any other relevant information in the text that could be related to claims or facts.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I found some potential claims:\n\n1. **Risk avoidance and virtual simulation**: The text mentions \"如何规避环境生态风险\" which translates to \"how to avoid environmental ecological risks\". This could be interpreted as a claim about risk management.\n2. **Virtual simulation experiment**: The text also mentions \"虚拟仿真实验带你走起\" which translates to \"virtual simulation experiments will take you on a journey\". This could be seen as a claim about the effectiveness of virtual simulation.\n\nHowever, these claims do not match any specific entities or claim types mentioned in the problem statement. \n\n**Step 3: Format each claim**\n\nSince there are no valid entities to associate with the claims, I cannot format them according to the specified format.\n\n**Step 4: Return output**\n\nGiven that there are no matching entities and claims that meet the specified criteria, the output will be:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, if we were to extract some general information from the text, it could be presented as follows (keeping in mind this does not follow the exact format specified):\n\n**NONE**<|>**NONE**<|>RISK MANAGEMENT<|>**SUSPECTED**<|>**NONE**<|>**NONE**<|>Text mentions risk avoidance and virtual simulation experiment<|>Text mentions risk avoidance and virtual simulation experiment\n##\n**NONE**<|>**NONE**<|>VIRTUAL SIMULATION EXPERIMENT<|>**SUSPECTED**<|>**NONE**<|>**NONE**<|>Text mentions virtual simulation experiments will take you on a journey<|>Text mentions virtual simulation experiments will", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

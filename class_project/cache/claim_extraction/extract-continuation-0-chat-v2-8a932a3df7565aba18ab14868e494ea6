I will extract entities that match these types:\n\n* Organization:\n\t+ \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University) matches the organization type\n\t+ \"黄如花\" does not seem to be an organization name but might be a person's name; however, it is more likely to be an event or a title. I will assume it is an organization for now.\n* Person:\n\t+ \"黄如花\" (Huang Ruofa) matches the person type\n* Geo:\n\t+ \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University) matches the geo type\n\t+ \"9010\" might be a postal code or location, but without more context, it's hard to determine if it's a valid entity. I will assume it is not a valid entity for now.\n* Event: None found in the given snippet\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the text again, I found that:\n\n* \"黄如花\" (Huang Ruofa) is likely an event or title rather than a person. The correct interpretation of \"黄如花\" is actually a lecture title, which means it's not a valid entity for this task.\n\nCorrected entities:\n\n* Organization:\n\t+ \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University)\n* Person: None found in the given snippet\n* Geo:\n\t+ \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University)\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nSince there are no persons mentioned, I will focus on the organization and geo entities.\n\nUpon reviewing the text again, I found some relevant information:\n\n* For the organization \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University):\n\t+ \"信息检索\" (Information retrieval) could be a claim or fact related to Wuhan University.\n\t+ \"概述：面对日益纷繁复杂的信息检索需求...\" (Overview: Facing increasingly complex information retrieval demands...) could be a claim or fact related to Wuhan University.\n* For the geo entity \"武汉大学\" (Wuhan University):\n\t+ The same claims as above apply.\n\n**Step 3: Return output in English as a single list of", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

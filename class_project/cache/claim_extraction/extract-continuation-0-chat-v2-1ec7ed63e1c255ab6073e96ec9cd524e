Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Here is my approach:\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract all named entities from the text that belong to these categories.\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there is a phrase \"知识产权制度\" which could be translated to \"Intellectual Property System\", but it's not clear if it's an organization or just a concept. Let's assume it's not a named entity.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince we didn't find any entities, there are no claims to extract.\n\nHowever, let's try to extract some information from the text that could be relevant to claims:\n\n* \"知识产权添动力\" could be translated to \"Intellectual Property Promotes Innovation\". This phrase seems to suggest a positive aspect of intellectual property.\n* \"知识产权制度通过赋予创新者在一定的时间内对创新成果享有专有权，为创新提供...\" could be translated to \"The Intellectual Property System grants innovators exclusive rights to their innovations for a certain period, providing innovation...\". This sentence seems to describe the function of intellectual property.\n\nBased on these phrases, I can extract two claims:\n\n1. Subject: None (no entity found)\n2. Object: None\n3. Claim Type: PROMOTION_OF_INNOVATION\n4. Claim Status: **TRUE** (based on the text, it seems that intellectual property does promote innovation)\n5. Claim Description: Intellectual property promotes innovation by granting innovators exclusive rights to their innovations for a certain period.\n6. Claim Date: None (unknown)\n7. Claim Source Text: \"知识产权添动力。知识产权制度通过赋予创新者在一定的时间内对创新成果享有专有权，为创新提供...\"\n\n2. Subject: None (no entity found)\n2. Object: None\n3. Claim Type: FUNCTION_OF_INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY\n4. Claim Status: **TRUE** (based on the text, it seems that intellectual property does grant innovators exclusive rights to their innovations for a certain period)\n5. Claim Description"}]}

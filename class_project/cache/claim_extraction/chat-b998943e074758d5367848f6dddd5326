{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following named entities:\n\n* organization: none\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: none (but \"时间\" can be translated to English as \"time\" or \"event\", so I will consider it as an entity)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that the text is written in Chinese and contains characters like \"\" which are not easily translatable to English. After re-examining the text, I found a few potential entities:\n\n* organization: none\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: none\n\nBut then, I noticed the word \"\" which can be translated to \"时间\" or \"event\". However, this is not an entity that matches the specification.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the text again. Upon further inspection, I found a few potential entities:\n\n* organization: none\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: \"\" which can be translated to \"检查\" or \"event\"\n\nHowever, this is not an entity that matches the specification.\n\nLet me try again. This time, I will look for any words that match the entity types in the specification.\n\n* organization: none\n* person: \"\" (which can be translated to \"领导\")\n* geo: none\n* event: \"\" (which can be translated to \"检查\")\n\nAh-ha! I found a few potential entities that match the specification. Now, let me extract all claims associated with these entities.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following claims:\n\n1. Subject: 领导 (Leader)\nObject: NONE\nClaim Type: CORRUPTION\nClaim Status: SUSPECTED\nClaim Description: The leader may not have enough time to deal with inspections, so they divided the project and avoided the bidding process.\nClaim Date: NONE\nClaim Source Text: \"\"可能来不及应付领导检查，所以就把工程拆分，规避招投标程序，以此能够赶上领导的检查。\n\n2. Subject: 检查 (Inspection)\nObject: NONE\nClaim Type: EVENT\nClaim Status: NONE\nClaim Description: The inspection is mentioned as a reason for the leader's actions.\nClaim Date: NONE\nClaim Source Text", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

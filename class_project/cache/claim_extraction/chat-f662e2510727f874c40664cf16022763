{"result": "Based on the input provided, I will extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n**Step 1: Entity Extraction**\n\nThe entity specification is ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. The text does not contain any clear references to organizations, persons, or events. However, it does mention \"天津大学\" (Tianjin University), which can be classified as a geo-location.\n\n**Step 2: Claim Extraction**\n\nSince there are no entities that match the organization, person, or event specifications, I will extract claims related to the only entity found, which is \"天津大学\".\n\nThe text does not contain any explicit claims about Tianjin University. However, it can be inferred that the course \"化工导论\" (Introduction to Chemical Engineering) offered by Tianjin University might be relevant for information discovery.\n\nHere is a claim extracted from the text:\n\n(天津大学<|>NONE<|>EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE<|>TRUE<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-01-31T00:00:00<|>天津大学的化工导论课程是为大专院校化工类学生及化工专科生的重要参考资料.<|>天津大学《化工导论》课程是为大专院校化工类学生及化工专科生的重要参考资料.)\n\nHowever, this claim does not match the specified format exactly. The subject entity is \"天津大学\", but there is no clear object entity. I will adjust the output to fit the required format:\n\n(天津大学<|>NONE<|>EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE<|>TRUE<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-01-31T00:00:00<|>《化工导论》课程是为大专院校化工类学生及化工专科生的重要参考资料.<|>天津大学《化工导论》课程是为大专院校化工类学生及化工专科生的重要参考资料.)\n\n**Step 3: Output**\n\nSince there is only one claim, the output will be a single list of claims:\n\n(天津大学<|>NONE<|>EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE<|>TRUE<|>2023-01-", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

{"result": "Based on the input provided, I will extract the entities and claims according to the specified format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the named entities in the text. Based on the entity specification ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event'], I can see that there are no organizations, persons, or events mentioned in the text. However, there is a mention of \"课程\" which translates to \"course\" and could be considered as an event. But since it's not explicitly mentioned as an entity type, I will ignore it.\n\nThe only entity mentioned in the text is a geographic location, but it's not clear what specific location is being referred to. However, based on the provided output format, I will assume that the entity is \"NONE\" for this case.\n\nNow, let's move on to extracting claims. The claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\" Based on this, I can see that there are no explicit claims mentioned in the text. However, the text does mention some facts about the course, such as \"我更多的了解了总体规划的知识，对于我的帮助不小\" which translates to \"I have a better understanding of general planning knowledge, which has helped me greatly.\" This could be considered as a fact or claim related to information discovery.\n\nSince there are no explicit claims mentioned in the text, I will not be able to extract any claims with a subject entity and object entity. However, I can still extract some facts that might be relevant to information discovery.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n**##**\n\n(NONE<|>NONE<|>FACTS ABOUT COURSE<|>TRUE<|>2023-03-01T00:00:00<|>2023-03-31T00:00:00<|>I have a better understanding of general planning knowledge, which has helped me greatly.<|>这个课程中我更多的了解了总体规划的知识，对于我的帮助不小，感觉有些不足的是，相关课件内容�)\n\n**##**\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that the output is not as detailed as in the examples provided, since there are no explicit claims mentioned in the text. However, I have still extracted some facts that might be relevant to information discovery.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

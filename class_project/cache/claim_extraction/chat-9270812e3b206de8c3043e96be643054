{"result": "I'll do my best to extract the claims and entities from the given text.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the named entities that match the entity specification. The entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. After analyzing the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* Organization: NONE (no organization is mentioned)\n* Person: NONE (no person is explicitly mentioned, but \"大师\" can be translated to \"Master\", which could be a person or an organization. However, based on the context, it seems more likely that \"大师\" refers to an organization or entity rather than a specific person.)\n* Geo: NONE (no geographic location is mentioned)\n* Event: NONE (no event is explicitly mentioned)\n\nSince there are no entities matching the specification, I will return an empty list.\n\nHowever, based on the claim description \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\", I can still extract some information from the text. Here's a possible output:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: Since there are no entities matching the specification, I couldn't extract any claims with subject entities. The extracted information is not in the required format.\n\nHowever, if we relax the entity specification to include 'organization' or 'person', we can extract some information from the text. For example:\n\n Entity specification: ['organization']\n Claim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\n Text: ...\n\n Output:\n## \n(大师<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>当我威震武林才知道大师的智慧\"\"<|>当我威震武林才知道大师的智慧\")\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n Entity specification: ['person']\n Claim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\n Text: ...\n\n Output:\n## \n(大师<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>当我威震武林才知道大师的智慧\"\"<|>当我威震武林才知道大师的智慧)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nPlease note that the extracted information is not very relevant to the claim description, and the output might not be accurate. The text seems to be a mix of Chinese characters and English phrases, which makes it difficult to extract meaningful information.\n\nIf you provide more context or clarify", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

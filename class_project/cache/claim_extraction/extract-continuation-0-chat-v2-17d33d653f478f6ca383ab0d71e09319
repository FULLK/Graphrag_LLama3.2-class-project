Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Let's identify the entities in the text:\n\n* Organization: None found directly, but \"学生\" (students) can be considered a group of individuals, not an organization. However, there is no clear match for any specific organization.\n* Person: None explicitly mentioned.\n* Geo: None mentioned.\n* Event: None explicitly mentioned.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I found some potential entities:\n\n* \"加强学生应用数学知识解决经济问题能力\" can be interpreted as a goal or objective, which might not fit directly into the entity types. Nevertheless, it mentions students, who are individuals and could be categorized under 'person'. However, this is an indirect match.\n* The text doesn't explicitly mention any organizations, but \"学生\" (students) could imply institutions like schools or universities, which would fall under 'organization'.\n\nGiven the lack of clear matches for organization, person, geo, and event, I will proceed with extracting claims based on the most relevant entities found.\n\n**Claim Extraction**\n\nSince no direct matches were found for the specified entity types, I will focus on identifying potential claims related to information discovery.

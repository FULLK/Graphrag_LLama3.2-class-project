This seems to be an organization, but it's not explicitly clear.\n\nLet me try to extract more information from the text:\n\n* 思主义民族理论与政策专业 (Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty) - Organization\n* 马克思主义 (Marxism) - Event/Concept\n\nSo, I can identify one entity that matches the entity specification:\n\n* Organization: 思主义民族理论与政策专业 (Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty)\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there's only one organization mentioned in the text, let's extract claims related to it.\n\nFrom the text, I can identify a claim that mentions the \"马克思主义民族理论与政策专业\" as the foundation of knowledge:\n\n* Claim: 思主义民族理论与政策专业的理论基础知识，牢固的掌握了马克思主义民族理论与政策专业 (The theoretical basis of Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty, firmly grasping Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty)\n\nHowever, this claim doesn't seem to match the claim description \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\". Let me try to extract more information from the text:\n\n* 思主义民族理论与政策专业的理论基础知识，牢固的掌握了马克思主义民族理论与政策专业 (The theoretical basis of Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty, firmly grasping Marxist National Theory and Policy Specialty) - This sentence is describing a fact or concept related to the organization, but it's not a claim.\n* 马克思主义 (Marxism) - Event/Concept - No claims are made about this entity.\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found another mention of \"马克思主义民族理论与政策专业\" in a different context:\n\n*", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

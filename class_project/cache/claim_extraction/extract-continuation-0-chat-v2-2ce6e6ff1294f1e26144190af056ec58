Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Here's my approach:\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nIn the given text, we need to extract entities of type 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. However, upon reviewing the text, I realize that there are no explicit mentions of organizations, people, or geographic locations. But, I can try to identify some implicit entities.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I found a mention of \"大学生\" which could be translated to \"university students\", but it's not an explicit entity. However, I did find the word \"\" (yǎng xīn jiàn shēn) which is a course name.\n\nAs for events, I couldn't find any explicit mentions.\n\nSo, my extracted entities are:\n\n* None of type 'organization'\n* None of type 'person'\n* None of type 'geo'\n* None of type 'event'\n\nHowever, I did extract one entity related to the claim description: \"\" (yǎng xīn jiàn shēn) which is a course name.\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nSince we didn't find any entities of type 'organization', 'person', or 'geo', I'll focus on extracting claims related to the extracted entity \"\" (yǎng xīn jiàn shēn).\n\nUpon reviewing the text again, I found a mention of \"\" which could be translated to \"promote university students' physical and mental balance\".\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realized that this is not a claim but rather a description of the course.\n\nBut, I did find another sentence: \"\" (gāi kè chéng jī dì) which translates to \"the curriculum design takes into account the unique physical and mental characteristics of university students\".\n\nThis could be interpreted as a claim related to the entity \"\" (yǎng xīn jiàn shēn).\n\n**Step 3: For each claim, extract the following information**\n\nFor the extracted claim:\n\n* Subject: None (no explicit subject)\n* Object: None (no explicit object)\n* Claim Type: COURSE DESIGN\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Description: The curriculum design takes into account the unique physical and mental characteristics of university students.\n* Claim Date: None (unknown date"}]}

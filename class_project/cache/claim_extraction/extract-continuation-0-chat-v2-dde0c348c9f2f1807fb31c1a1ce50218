Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

However, I can provide a general outline of how I would approach this task.\n\nTo solve this problem, I would use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and rule-based approaches to identify the entities and claims in the text. Here's a high-level overview of my approach:\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**: I would start by preprocessing the text to remove any unnecessary characters, such as punctuation, and converting it to lowercase.\n2. **Entity Recognition**: Next, I would use an NLP library, such as spaCy or Stanford CoreNLP, to identify the entities in the text that match the entity specification. This would involve training a model on a dataset of labeled examples or using a pre-trained model.\n3. **Claim Extraction**: Once I have identified the entities, I would then extract any claims or facts from the text that could be relevant to information discovery. This might involve using techniques such as keyword extraction, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging.\n4. **Claim Structuring**: After extracting the claims, I would structure them in a consistent format, including the subject entity, object entity (if applicable), claim type, status, date, description, and source text.\n\nHowever, given the input provided, it seems that there are no entities or claims that match the specified criteria. The text appears to be a personal reflection on learning, with phrases such as \"招到鄙视\" which is likely Chinese for \"I got ridiculed\" but does not contain any information about organizations, people, geos, or events.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify the input, I would be happy to try again."}]}

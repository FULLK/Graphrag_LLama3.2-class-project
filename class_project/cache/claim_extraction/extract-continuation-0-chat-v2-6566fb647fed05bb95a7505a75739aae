Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We need to extract all named entities from the text that fall into these categories.\n\nFrom the given text:\n```\n1001328001-集美大学\n```\n\nWe can identify:\n\n* `集美大学` as an **organization** (note: this might be a Chinese university, so it may not directly translate to English. However, for simplicity and following the instruction, we'll treat it as an organization)\n* No other named entities clearly fall into the categories of `person`, `geo`, or `event`.\n\n### Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.\n\nSince there is only one identified entity (`集美大学`), let's proceed to extract claims related to it. The claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\"\n\nFrom the text:\n```\n\"1001328001-集美大学\n```\n\nThere are no explicit claims made about `集美大学`. However, we can infer a fact: the existence of \"集美大学\" itself could be considered a claim related to its existence or presence.\n\n### Step 3: Format each claim according to the specified format\n\nGiven that our identified entity and associated facts do not directly translate into claims with clear subject-object relationships as described in the task, we will have to adjust our approach. However, for the sake of completing the exercise:\n\n* Subject: `集美大学` (capitalized)\n* Object: **NONE** (since there is no explicit action or relationship mentioned that involves another entity)\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION_EXISTENCE (a broad categorization for the existence of information about an entity)\n* Claim Status: TRUE (since it's a fact, but note this might not align with the task's intent which seems to focus on claims that attribute actions or characteristics rather than mere existence)\n* Claim Description: The university exists.\n* Claim Date: **NONE** (no specific date is mentioned in the text for the claim of existence)\n* Claim Source Text: The entire text provided.\n\nSo, the formatted claim would be:\n```\n(集美大学<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION_EXIST"}]}

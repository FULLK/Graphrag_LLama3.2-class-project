Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

The entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We can use a natural language processing (NLP) library like spaCy to perform entity recognition on the text.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, we found the following entities:\n\n* Entity 1: 西北农林科技大学 (Northwest Agricultural and Forestry University)\n\t+ Type: organization\n* Entity 2: 仵均祥 (Wu Junxiang)\n\t+ Type: person\n\nSince there are no geographic locations or events mentioned in the text, we can ignore those entity types.\n\nNext, let's extract all claims associated with these entities. We'll look for sentences that mention either of these entities and describe some fact or claim about them.\n\nWe found two relevant sentences:\n\n* Sentence 1: \"9021-西北农林科技大学-仵均祥\t农业\"\n\t+ Entity: 西北农林科技大学 (Northwest Agricultural and Forestry University)\n\t+ Claim Description: This sentence appears to be a classification or categorization of the university, but it's not clear what it means.

Ignore.\n\nWait, what about the first sentence? Let's try to extract some information from it:\n\n* Sentence 1: 课有什么意义吗？我还不如直接看书呢\n\t+ Entity: NONE (no specific entity mentioned)\n\t+ Claim Description: This sentence is a question asking about the meaning of \"课\" (which might refer to a course or lesson). The response is that it's not as useful as reading books directly. Ignore.\n\nHowever, let's take another look at Sentence 1:\n\n* 课有什么意义吗？我还不如直接看书呢\n\t+ Entity: NONE (no specific entity mentioned)\n\t+ Claim Description: This sentence asks"}]}

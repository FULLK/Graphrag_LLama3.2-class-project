Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We can see two organizations mentioned in the text: None are explicitly mentioned as an organization, but there is a mention of \"航海\" which translates to sailing, and hence we can assume it refers to a journey related to maritime or naval activities. However, no specific entities match the given entity specification.\n\nNext, let's move on to claims against these entities. Since there are no entities that match the entity specification, there will be no claims to extract.\n\nHowever, upon further review of the text, we find that \"航海若干年\" translates to sailing for several years which implies a journey/event but does not explicitly mention an event or organization. Hence it can be considered as a description rather than an entity in this context.\n\nSince there are no entities matching the specification and no claims against those entities, the output will be:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, if we relax our interpretation of the text to consider \"航海若干年\" as an event or journey, then we can still proceed with extracting claims. \n\nLet's assume that \"航海若干年\" is indeed an event or a type of event (journey). In this case, we would need to extract claims related to events.\n\nUpon reviewing the text again, there are no specific claims made against any entities mentioned in the text. Hence the output remains empty.\n\nHowever, if we consider that \"评价：已经航海若干年\" could be interpreted as a claim or fact about an event (journey), then we can still proceed with extracting information related to this claim.\n\nHere's what we have:\n\n- Subject: None explicitly mentioned\n- Object: **NONE**\n- Claim Type: Information about an Event/Journey\n- Claim Status: **TRUE** \n- Claim Description: The person has been sailing for several years.\n- Claim Date: **NONE**\n\nBut since no entity matches the specification, this information cannot be extracted as per the original request.\n\nHowever, given that there are no claims to extract based on the provided text and entity specification, we can still provide an example of how the output would look if there were entities and claims to extract:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nIf we consider \"航海若干年\" as a journey"}]}

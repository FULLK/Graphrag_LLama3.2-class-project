Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It seems like a conversation or question about design principles for steel reinforcement components. There is no clear claim or fact that can be extracted directly from this text.\n\nBut if we look at it more closely, there might be an implicit claim or fact hidden within the context of the conversation.\n\nFor example, the speaker might be asking about how to ensure that someone (not specified) meets certain requirements for design. This could potentially imply a claim or fact related to \"person\" entity type, but it's not explicitly stated and seems more like a question or statement rather than an actual claim.\n\nGiven this context, I will extract no claims from the text as there are no clear entities that match the predefined types and no explicit claims or facts can be extracted. \n\nHowever, for the sake of completion and following the format exactly as requested, I will return an empty list with **##** delimiter and then output `<|COMPLETE|>`.\n\n<|end_of_output|>\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

Therefore, I will treat \"华中\" as an organization and \"104001\" as a geo location.\n\nStep 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following claims:\n\n* Claim against 华中 (Huazhong):\n\t+ Subject: 华中\n\t+ Object: NONE\n\t+ Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: According to the text, 华中 provides necessary guidance on learning methods.\n\t+ Claim Source Text: 绍，对学习的方法作必要的指导。\n* Claim against 104001:\n\t+ Subject: 104001\n\t+ Object: NONE\n\t+ Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: According to the text, 104001 is a postal code.\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"104001-华中\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that these claims are not particularly relevant to information discovery. The first claim is simply stating that 华中 provides guidance on learning methods, which is not necessarily a claim or fact that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nThe second claim is even less relevant, as it only states the postal code 104001 without any additional context or information.\n\nTherefore, I will not include these claims in my final output.\n\nStep 3: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nSince I did not extract any relevant claims", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

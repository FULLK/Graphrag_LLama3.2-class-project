{"result": "I will extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities from the given text document.\n\nFirst, I will extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. The entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event'].\n\nFrom the text, I can identify the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there are some words that could be related to these entity types. For example:\n* \"帮助\" (help) and \"促进\" (promote) could be related to a person or an organization.\n* \"网络背景下\" (network background) could be related to a geo location.\n\nBut since the text does not provide enough information to extract specific entities, I will consider the entire text as one entity:\n\nEntity: None\n\nNext, for each entity identified in step 1, I will extract all claims associated with the entity. Since there are no specific entities extracted, I will look for any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following claim:\n\n* Claim description: Information exchange is a multi-directional communication process.\n* Claim type: INFORMATION DISCOVERY\n* Subject: None (no specific entity)\n* Object: None (no specific entity)\n* Claim status: **TRUE** (this is a general statement and not a claim against a specific entity)\n* Claim date: None (date is unknown)\n* Claim source text: \"己的聪明才智，相互帮助、促进，更好的解决问题。在网络背景下，学习是一种多向的信息交流\"\n\nSince there are no specific entities extracted, I will not be able to extract any claims that match the specified claim description.\n\nTherefore, my output is:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: Since there are no specific entities extracted and no claims against those entities, the output is empty.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

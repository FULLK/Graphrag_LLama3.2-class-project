{"result": "Based on the input provided, I will extract the entities and claims as per the steps outlined. However, please note that the text is in Chinese, which may require additional processing to extract relevant information.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities**\n\nUsing entity recognition techniques, I can identify some entities from the text:\n\n* Organization: **NONE** (no clear organization mentioned)\n* Person: **NONE** (no clear person mentioned)\n* Geo: **NONE** (no clear geographical location mentioned)\n* Event: **NONE** (no clear event mentioned)\n\nHowever, one entity that stands out is \"奉天承运皇帝诏曰从天而降\" which appears to be a title or a concept related to an organization.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with entities**\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I found some potential claims:\n\n1. **Claim 1**\n\t* Subject: **NONE** (no clear subject entity)\n\t* Object: **NONE** (no clear object entity)\n\t* Claim Type: **UNKNOWN** (unable to determine claim type)\n\t* Claim Status: **SUSPECTED** (claim is suspicious, but not confirmed)\n\t* Claim Description: \"抽象，戴上了一副“奉天承运皇帝诏曰从天而降的抽象定义和推理”的恐怖面具\" which translates to \"Abstract, wearing a mask with the title 'Punished by Heaven' and abstract definition and reasoning\"\n\t* Claim Date: **NONE** (unable to determine date)\n\t* Claim Source Text: The entire text\n2. **Claim 2**\n\t* Subject: **NONE** (no clear subject entity)\n\t* Object: **NONE** (no clear object entity)\n\t* Claim Type: **UNKNOWN** (unable to determine claim type)\n\t* Claim Status: **SUSPECTED** (claim is suspicious, but not confirmed)\n\t* Claim Description: \"本课\" which translates to \"This course\"\n\t* Claim Date: **NONE** (unable to determine date)\n\t* Claim Source Text: The entire text\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to extract any clear claims or entities that match the specified claim description. The text appears to be a passage of abstract concepts and does not contain specific claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim**\n\nSince there are no clear claims or entities, I", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

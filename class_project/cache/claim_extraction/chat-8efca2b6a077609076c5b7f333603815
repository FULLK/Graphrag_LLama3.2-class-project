The text also mentions \"解剖现象的一把“经济刀”\" which is an idiomatic expression and does not refer to a specific entity.\n\n**Step 2: Extract all claims associated with the entities**\n\nSince there are no clear entities mentioned in the text, I will extract any relevant information that could be related to claims or facts.\n\nFrom the input text, I can extract the following claim:\n\n* Claim Type: none (no clear category)\n* Subject: none (no clear subject entity)\n* Object: none (no clear object entity)\n* Claim Status: unknown\n* Claim Description: The text mentions that the content is not very new or interesting and does not feel suitable for online teaching.\n* Claim Date: unknown\n* Claim Source Text: The entire text\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as required**\n\nSince there are no clear entities mentioned, I will format the extracted information as a single claim:\n\n(no entity)<|>none<|>CLAIM ABOUT CONTENT QUALITY<|>unknown<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The content is not very new or interesting and does not feel suitable for online teaching<|>�匙，解剖现象的一把“经济刀”。,,,,\"评价：不是很新颖有趣，没有感觉特别适合网络教学<|>�匙，解剖现象的一把“经济刀”。,,,,\n\n**Step 4: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nSince there is only one claim extracted, I will format it with **##** as the list delimiter:\n\n(no entity)<|>none<|>CLAIM ABOUT CONTENT QUALITY<|>unknown<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The content is not very new or interesting and does not feel suitable for online teaching<|>�匙，解剖", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n**Step 1: Extract entities**\n\nFrom the text, I can identify the following entities:\n\n* Entity type: organization\n\t+ 西安交通大学 (Xi'an Jiaotong University)\n* Entity type: person\n\t+ 孙慧玲 (Sun Huiling)\n\nNo entities of types 'geo' or 'event' are found in the provided text.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims**\n\nFor each entity, I will extract all claims associated with it. Since there is only one sentence in the text, I will analyze it as a single claim.\n\n* Claim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n* Subject entity: 西安交通大学 (Xi'an Jiaotong University)\n* Object entity: NONE\n* Claim type: EDUCATION\n* Claim status: TRUE\n* Claim date: UNKNOWN\n* Claim source text: \"\"概述：《口腔解剖生理学》是口腔\n\n**Step 3: Format claim**\n\nThe extracted claim is formatted as follows:\n\n(西安交通大学<|>NONE<|>EDUCATION<|>TRUE<|>UNKNOWN<|>UNKNOWN<|>\"概述：《口腔解剖生理学》是口腔)\n\n**Step 4: Return output**\n\nThe final output is a single list of claims, using **##** as the delimiter:\n\n(西安交通大学<|>NONE<|>EDUCATION<|>TRUE<|>UNKNOWN<|>UNKNOWN<|>\"概述：《口腔解剖生理学》是口腔)##\n(PERSON SUN HUILING<|>NONE<|>NO CLAIM TYPE<|>UNKNOWN<|>UNKNOWN<|>NO CLAIM SOURCE TEXT<|>)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: Since there is no explicit claim for the person entity, I couldn't assign a claim type or source text. The output for the person entity is incomplete.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the text might be describing a course taught by Sun Huiling at Xi'an Jiaotong University, and the relevant information for information discovery is the course title and description, then we could reformat the claims as follows:\n\n(西安交通大学<|>NONE<|>EDUC", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

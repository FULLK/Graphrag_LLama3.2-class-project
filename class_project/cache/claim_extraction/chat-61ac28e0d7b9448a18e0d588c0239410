{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract all entities and claims according to the specified format.\n\n**Entity Extraction**\n\nThe entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. Let's extract the relevant entities from the text:\n\n* Organization: None found in the text.\n* Person: None explicitly mentioned as a person. However, \"你\" (you) is used in the second sentence, which can be interpreted as a generic term for a person. But it's not clear who this person is or their specific role.\n* Geo: None explicitly mentioned as a geographic location.\n* Event: The text mentions \"下一步你要站在哪里\", but it's unclear what event this refers to.\n\nHowever, I will extract some entities that can be inferred from the text:\n\n* Entity 1: \"海员\" (seaman/ sailor) - This is an occupation or profession, not a specific organization. However, if we consider it as an entity type, it could be related to the claim.\n* Entity 2: None other than the generic term \"你\" (you).\n\n**Claim Extraction**\n\nThe claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\". Let's extract some claims from the text:\n\n1. Claim 1:\n\t* Subject: **海员** (seaman/ sailor)\n\t* Object: None\n\t* Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n\t* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n\t* Claim Description: The text mentions learning about seamen and their lives, but it's unclear what specific information is being discovered.\n\t* Claim Date: Unknown\n\t* Claim Source Text: \"就能学习航海英语，了解海员的生活和工作\"\n2. Claim 2:\n\t* Subject: **你** (you)\n\t* Object: None\n\t* Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n\t* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n\t* Claim Description: The text mentions standing somewhere, but it's unclear what specific information is being discovered.\n\t* Claim Date: Unknown\n\t* Claim Source Text: \"下一步你要站在哪里\"\n\n**Output**\n\nSince there are no clear entities matching the specified types and claim descriptions that can be extracted with certainty from the provided text, I will provide a minimal output.\n\n(C海员<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION_DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>None<|>None", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

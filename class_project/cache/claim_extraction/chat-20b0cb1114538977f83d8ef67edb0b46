{"result": "I will guide you through the process of extracting entities and claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nFrom the text, we can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: 巨变 (Jiū biàn) - a company name\n* person: None found directly\n* geo: None found directly\n* event: None found directly\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, \"巨变\" is likely an event or term related to a significant change, but it's not clear if it refers to a specific organization or entity. Let's assume it's an event for now.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nFor the extracted entities (and assuming \"巨变\" is an event), we can extract the following claims:\n\n* Claim 1:\n\t+ Subject: 巨变\n\t+ Object: None\n\t+ Claim Type: EVENT/CHANGE\n\t+ Claim Status: **TRUE** (as it's mentioned in the text)\n\t+ Claim Description: The text mentions a significant change or event.\n\t+ Claim Date: None found\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"巨变。在新兴和传统制造业并存的时代...\"\n* Claim 2:\n\t+ Subject: None\n\t+ Object: 巨变\n\t+ Claim Type: None (no clear claim type)\n\t+ Claim Status: **TRUE** (as it's mentioned in the text)\n\t+ Claim Description: The text mentions the course design considers industry status with progress, but no specific claim about \"巨变\".\n\t+ Claim Date: None found\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"...本课程在教学设计上考虑行业现状，与时俱进...\"\n\nSince we have two claims, and there are no other entities extracted, our output will be:\n\n**<|COMPLETE|>**\n\nHowever, since the output format requires a list of all claims identified, and there's only one claim with an object (Claim 1), the output should look like this:\n\n(JIŪ BIÀN<|>NONE<|>EVENT/CHANGE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The text mentions a significant change or event.<|>巨变。在新兴和传统制造业并存的时代...)\n##", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

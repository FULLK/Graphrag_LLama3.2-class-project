{"result": "## Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification from the text document.\nThe given text is: \"教师团队。本课程按照历史顺序，介绍了从史前到清代结束7000多年间我国古典家具的...\"\n\nEntity specification: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\n\nFrom this text, we can extract entities as follows:\n\n- Organization: None\n- Person: None\n- Geo: China (implied by \"我国\")\n- Event: History (general term), but no specific event is mentioned.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems that there's an error in the initial analysis. The text doesn't explicitly mention entities like organizations or persons. But we can infer some entities based on the context:\n\n- Organization: None\n- Person: None\n- Geo: China (implied by \"我国\")\n- Event: None\n\nHowever, given the entity specification includes 'geo' and it's mentioned as \"我国\" which means \"my country\", we can assume China is the geo entity.\n\n## Step 2: For each extracted entity, identify claims associated with that entity.\nSince there are no explicit claims against entities in this text, let's re-evaluate the task for the given example:\n\nEntity specification: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\nClaim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nUpon a closer look at the text, we can infer some general statements about China's history and its cultural heritage. However, these are not specific enough to constitute \"claims\" in the context of our task.\n\n## Step 3: Extract the necessary information for each claim.\nSince there are no specific claims identified from the given text, let's create hypothetical examples based on a more typical scenario:\n\n- Subject Entity: CHINA\n- Object Entity: None\n- Claim Type: GEOGRAPHICAL FACT\n- Claim Status: TRUE\n- Claim Description: China has a rich history spanning over 7000 years.\n- Claim Date: NONE (since this is a general fact and not tied to a specific date)\n- Claim Source Text: \"介绍了从史前到清代结束7000多年间我国古典家具的...\"\n\n## Step 4: Format each claim according to the required format.\nGiven the hypothetical example:\n\n(CHINA<|>NONE<|>GEOGRAPHICAL FACT<|", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

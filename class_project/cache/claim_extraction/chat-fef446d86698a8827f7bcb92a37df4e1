{"result": "Based on the provided real data, I will extract the entities and claims as per the specified steps.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: 大学 (University)\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that \"大学\" is not an exact match for any of the specified entity types. It seems more like a generic term for a university rather than a specific type.\n\nIf we broaden the entity specification to include other types, such as \"location\", I can extract:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: 大学 (University) can be considered a location, but it's not clear if it refers to a specific city or region. Let's assume it doesn't match any of the specified entity types.\n* event: None\n\nHowever, upon re-reading the text, I realize that there is no specific information about an organization, person, geo, or event.\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nSince no entities matching the specified types were found, there are no claims to extract.\n\n**Step 3: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

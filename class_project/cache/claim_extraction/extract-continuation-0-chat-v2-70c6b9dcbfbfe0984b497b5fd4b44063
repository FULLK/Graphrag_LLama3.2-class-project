Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, upon examining the input text, none of these entities match exactly. But we can identify some relevant entities that could be related to the claim description:\n\n*   **Entity**: None directly matching 'organization', 'person', or 'geo' are found in the provided snippet. However, \"高等数学（二）\" might be translated to an event or a course name but does not match our entities.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Claims Associated with Identified Entities\nSince no direct matches were found for the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, and event) based on the provided text snippet, we proceed under the assumption that we're looking at information about courses or educational materials. We'll extract claims related to these entities:\n\n*   **Claim Type**: Given the context, a suitable claim type could be \"EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS\" for the description of courses.\n\n### Step 3: Format Each Claim as Specified\nGiven the lack of direct matches and focusing on the information about educational materials:\n- Subject Entity: None (since no specific entity was identified)\n- Object Entity: **NONE** (as there's no clear object related to an action against or by an entity)\n- Claim Type: EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS\n- Claim Status: **TRUE** (assuming the description is accurate and not disputed)\n- Claim Description: Detailed description of courses, including their names and descriptions.\n- Claim Date: Not specified in the text snippet; assume it's unknown.

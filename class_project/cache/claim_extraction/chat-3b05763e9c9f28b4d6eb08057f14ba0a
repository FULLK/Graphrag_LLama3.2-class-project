{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract the entities and claims as per the specified steps.\n\n**Step 1:** Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification.\n\nIn this case, there are no explicit entity names mentioned in the text. However, we can assume that the text is likely to contain some form of reference to organizations, people, geographic locations, or events.\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there are a few words that could be classified as entities in other contexts. For example:\n\n* 复杂的 (complex) could refer to an event or situation, but it's not specific enough to be considered an entity.\n* 纷扰中 (disturbance) could also refer to an event or situation.\n\nSince the entity specification includes 'event', I will consider \"纷扰\" as a potential event entity. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine its relevance.\n\n**Step 2:** For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\n\nSince there are no explicit entities mentioned, I will focus on extracting claims related to general information discovery that could be relevant to any of the specified entities (organization, person, geo, event).\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I found one potential claim:\n\n* \"让我们一起走进\" (Let's walk in together) - This sentence is too vague and doesn't provide any specific information about an entity. It seems more like a call-to-action or an invitation.\n\nHowever, there are no claims that directly mention any of the specified entities or provide relevant information for discovery.\n\n**Step 3:** Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nSince I couldn't find any specific claims related to the specified entities, my final output will be:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: The provided text does not contain any relevant information for discovery about organizations, people, geographic locations, or events.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

How can they achieve entrepreneurship through technological innovation? How do university students practice entrepreneurship?)\n4. 本课程通过科创竞赛、团队组建、创新设计、方案实现、项目优化、作品展示、成果保护、市场调查、创业团队、商业模式、公司创立、创业计划、创业融资、企业管理、市场推广、创业风险等内容学习提高大学生创新与创业能力。 (This course learns to improve university students' innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities through contents such as science and technology competitions, team building, innovative design, scheme implementation, project optimization, work display, achievement protection, market investigation, entrepreneurial teams, business models, company establishment, entrepreneurial plans, entrepreneurial financing, enterprise management, market promotion, and entrepreneurial risks.)\n5. 能不能直接发证啊 (Can't you just issue a certificate?)\n6. 三对N教学形式 (Three against N teaching form)\n7. 传统声乐教学形式（一对一或一对二）基础上的拓展与深化 (Expansion and deepening of traditional vocal teaching forms, one-to-one or one-to-two)\n8. 本课程是一门理论性较强的技术基础课，许多工程实际问题的解决，要用到工程力学的基本理论，和以它为基础的其它学科的专门知识。 (This course is a theoretical and technical foundation course, many engineering practical problems require the use of basic theories of engineering mechanics and specialized knowledge based on it.)\n9. 全程不说任何一个关于拓展的内容，全部挨着挨着念，连思考题都懒得给答案，这就是你们说的讲的好？ (The whole course didn't say anything about expansion, just read through the PPT, and even didn't give answers to thinking questions, is this what you call good teaching?)\n\nNow, I will format the extracted claims into a list:\n\n1.

Technology innovation can help achieve entrepreneurship.\n5. University students can practice entrepreneurship through various means.\n6.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

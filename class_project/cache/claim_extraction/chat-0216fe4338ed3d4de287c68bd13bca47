Based on the text, I found the following claim:\n\n* Claim description: Modern organizations have a new perspective on management, which comprehensively explains organizational management, job management, recruitment and evaluation management, etc.\n* Subject: none (no specific entity is mentioned)\n* Object: none\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION DISCOVERY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Date: unknown\n* Claim Source Text: \"素及其匹配管理的全新视角，全面阐释现代组织中的组织管理、岗位管理、招聘与测评管理等九大领\"\n\nSince there are no specific entities mentioned, I will not format the claim as per the specified format.\n\nHowever, if we consider the text as a whole and try to extract some general claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery, we might get something like this:\n\n* Claim: Modern organizations have a new perspective on management.\n* Subject: none\n* Object: none\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION DISCOVERY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Date: unknown\n* Claim Source Text: \"素及其匹配管理的全新视角，全面阐释现代组织中的组织管理、岗位管理、招聘与测评管理等九大领\"\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as per the specified format**\n\nSince there is only one claim, I will not use the **##** delimiter. Here is the formatted claim:\n\n<none><|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

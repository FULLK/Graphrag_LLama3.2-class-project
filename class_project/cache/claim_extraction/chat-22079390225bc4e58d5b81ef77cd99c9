{"result": "Based on the provided input, I will extract the entities and claims as per the specified format.\n\nEntity specification: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\nClaim description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\nText: 术英语教学与研究的经验，多次获得省级和国家级教学成果奖，主持多个省和教育部教学\n\n**Step 1: Extract entities**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: 省 (province), 教育部 (Ministry of Education)\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, \"术\" is likely a typo and should be \"术语\" which translates to \"term\" or \"terminology\", not an entity. Also, the text mentions \"省级和国家级教学成果奖\", which implies that there are awards at both provincial and national levels, but it doesn't specify the names of these organizations.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following claim:\n\n* Subject: 省 (province)\n* Object: None\n* Claim Type: Teaching Awards\n* Claim Status: TRUE\n* Claim Description: Province-level and national-level teaching awards have been obtained.\n* Claim Date: Unknown\n* Claim Source Text: 术英语教学与研究的经验，多次获得省级和国家级教学成果奖\n\n**Step 3: Format the claim**\n\n(COMPANY A<|>NONE<|>TEACHING AWARDS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Province-level and national-level teaching awards have been obtained.<|>术英语教学与研究的经验，多次获得省级和国家级教学成果奖)\n\n**Step 4: Return output**\n\n(COMPANY A<|>NONE<|>TEACHING AWARDS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Province-level and national-level teaching awards have been obtained.<|>术英语教学与研究的经验，多次获得省级和国家级教学成果奖)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: Since there are no specific entities mentioned in the text, I couldn't extract any entity-related claims. The extracted claim is related to teaching awards at both provincial and national levels.\n\nHowever, if we consider \"省\" as an organization", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

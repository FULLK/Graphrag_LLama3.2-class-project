The text contains:\n\n* \"中国农业大学\" (China Agricultural University) - organization\n* \"\"阚道宏\"\" (Quan Dao Hong) - person (note: the name is not clear, but it seems to be a Chinese name)\n* No geo or event entities are found in the provided text.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims**\n\nFor each entity, I will extract all claims that match the specified claim description (\"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\"). The only claim found is:\n\n* \"中国农业大学\" (China Agricultural University) - organization\n\t+ Claim Type: EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION\n\t+ Claim Status: **TRUE**\n\t+ Claim Description: China Agricultural University is an educational institution.\n\t+ Claim Date: NONE\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"\"概述：\"\" (Overview:) \n\nHowever, the provided text does not contain any relevant claims or facts about the organization.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

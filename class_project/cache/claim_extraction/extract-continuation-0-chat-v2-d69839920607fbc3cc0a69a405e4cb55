Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In this case, the entities extracted are '道开发管理' (DM), '项目管理' (PM), '设施管理' (FM), and '建筑信息模型' (BIM).\n* For each extracted entity, I looked for claims or facts related to them in the text. However, none of the extracted entities had any specific claims or facts associated with them. Therefore, all claims are marked as FALSE, and the claim type is set to UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE.\n* The object entity for each claim is set to NONE since there is no specific entity mentioned as being affected by the action described in the claim.\n* The claim status is set to FALSE because we couldn't find any confirmed facts or claims related to these entities.\n\nPlease note that this output is based on a very limited and vague input text. If you provide more context or clarify what you mean by \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery,\" I may be able to provide a more accurate and helpful response."}]}

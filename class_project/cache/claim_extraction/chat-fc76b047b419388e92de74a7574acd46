{"result": "I will use the provided steps and examples to extract claims from the given text document.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract entities that match these types.\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I found no named entities that match the specified entity types. The text appears to be a description of a course and does not mention any organizations, persons, geo locations, or events.\n\n**Step 2: Since there are no entities to extract claims from, we will return an empty list**\n\nThere are no claims to extract.\n\n**Output**\n\nSince there are no entities and no claims to extract, the output is:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, I noticed that the text does contain some relevant information for a specific claim. The sentence \"位在读、已工作，或准备换工作的学员选修本课程\" can be translated to \"Students who are currently studying, have work experience, or are preparing to change jobs take this course\". This could be related to an event or a location where the course is being taught.\n\nIf we were to extract claims from this sentence, we might get:\n\n(NO EVENT<|>NO LOCATION<|>NO CLAIM TYPE<|>NONE<|>2023-02-20T00:00:00<|>2023-02-20T00:00:00<|>No relevant information available.<|>位在读、已工作，或准备换工作的学员选修本课程)\n\nHowever, this is not a valid claim according to the provided format.\n\nTherefore, the final output remains:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that I had to add some placeholder values for the entity types and dates since there are no actual entities or claims to extract.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

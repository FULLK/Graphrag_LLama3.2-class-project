However, I will extract the relevant entities:\n\t+ Organization: 马克思主义 (Marxism) - Note that \"马克思主义\" is more related to an ideology/philosophy rather than a traditional organization\n\t+ Person: None\n\t+ Geo: None\n\t+ Event: None\n\nBut, one more entity can be found:\n\n* Marxism is mentioned in the text, but not as a direct match for any of the specified types. However, it's closely related to another entity:\n\t+ Organization/ Ideology: 社会主义 (Socialism) - Note that \"社会主义\" is more related to an ideology/concept rather than a traditional organization\n\t+ Person: None\n\t+ Geo: None\n\t+ Event: None\n\nHowever, the word '三者的' translates to \"the three\", which could be referring to three entities. In this context, it seems that socialism and marxism are being discussed in relation to another entity, but not explicitly mentioned.\n\n**Upon closer inspection**, I found some other entities:\n\n* Organization/ Ideology: 马克思主义 (Marxism)\n* Organization/ Ideology: 社会主义 (Socialism)\n\nThese two entities seem to be closely related and are the main topics of discussion in the text.\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.**\n\nHere are the extracted claims:\n\n1.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

{"result": "I'll guide you through the process of extracting claims from the given text document.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. Let's extract the named entities from the text:\n\n*靶向药物、3D打印器官、个性化医疗、可穿戴设备等，产生交叉性学科——生物医学工程*\n\nFrom this text, we can identify the following named entities that match the entity specification:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there is one potential event mention: \"靶向药物、3D打印器官、个性化医疗、可穿戴设备等，产生交叉性学科——生物医学工程\" can be considered as an event description. Let's extract the entities mentioned in this sentence.\n\n* Targeting drugs, 3D-printed organs, personalized medicine, wearable devices, etc., produce interdisciplinary discipline—biomedical engineering*\n\nFrom this sentence, we can identify:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: Biomedical Engineering ( potential event mention)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems that \"Biomedical Engineering\" is not an event, but rather a field of study or discipline. Let's ignore this for now.\n\nUpon further analysis, we can identify the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there are some mentions of events in the text:\n\n* \"靶向药物\" (Targeted drugs) - This is a medical treatment approach.\n* \"3D打印器官\" (3D-printed organs) - This is a medical technology.\n* \"个性化医疗\" (Personalized medicine) - This is a medical approach.\n\nThese can be considered as potential event mentions. Let's extract the entities mentioned in these phrases:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event:\n\t+ Targeted drugs\n\t+ 3D-printed organs\n\t+ Personalized medicine\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we realize that \"Targeted drugs\" and \"Personalized medicine\" are not events, but rather medical approaches or treatments.\n\nThe only potential event mention is", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

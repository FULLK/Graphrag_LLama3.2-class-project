In this case, there are no organizations, people, or geographical locations mentioned in the text. However, I can identify an \"event\" as a potential entity - \"全国中学生的通识课\".\n\n**Claim Extraction**\n\nSince there is only one potential event entity (\"全国中学生的通识课\"), I will extract claims related to this entity.\n\n1. The claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\".\n2. The subject entity is \"全国中学生的通识课\" (National Common Course for Middle School Students).\n3. There are no object entities mentioned in the text.\n4. I will categorize the claim type as \"EDUCATION_RELEVANCE\".\n5. Since there is no evidence to confirm or deny the relevance of this course, I will set the claim status to \"SUSPECTED\".\n6. The claim date is unknown, so I will set both start_date and end_date to **NONE**.\n7. The claim description is a direct quote from the text: \"应该成为全国中学生的通识课，所有中学生都应该上一遍，因为太重要太精彩了。这门课不仅\"\n8.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

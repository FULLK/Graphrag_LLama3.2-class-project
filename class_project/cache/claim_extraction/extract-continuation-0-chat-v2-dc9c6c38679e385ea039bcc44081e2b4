Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

I will use this list to identify entities in the text.\n\nAfter processing the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, I can see some potential entity mentions that don't match exactly. For example, \"老师\" could be a person, and \"具体的东西\" might refer to a location or an object.\n\nTo make progress, I'll assume the following entities:\n\n* organization: None (no exact matches)\n* person: None (no exact matches, but possibly \"老师\")\n* geo: None (no exact matches)\n* event: None (no exact matches)\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no exact matches for organizations, people, geos, or events, I'll look for any potential claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found a few mentions that might be relevant:\n\n* \"脱离实际\" - This phrase could refer to an event or concept related to information discovery.\n* \"具体的东西\" - This phrase might describe a type of data or resource related to information discovery.\n* \"老师\" - As mentioned earlier, this could potentially refer to a person involved in teaching or guiding others on information discovery.\n\nHowever, without more context or specific entity matches, I won't create claims for these mentions.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as required**\n\nSince there are no valid claims to extract, the output will be empty.

Without sufficient context or exact matches, it's challenging to extract meaningful claims from the text."}]}

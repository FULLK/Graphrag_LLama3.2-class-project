{"result": "I will use the provided real data as input for my answer.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: None (no clear indication of an organization)\n* person: None (no clear indication of a person)\n* geo: None (no clear indication of a geographical location)\n* event: None (no clear indication of an event)\n\nHowever, there is one mention that could be related to an entity:\n\n* \"\"抢沙发\"，为丽...\"\n\nIt seems like \"抢沙发\" might refer to a specific event or situation, but I couldn't find any other relevant information about it.\n\nSince there are no clear matches for the specified entities, I will move on to the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is one potential mention of an event:\n\n* \"\"抢沙发\"，为丽...\"\n\nHowever, without more context or information about this phrase, it's difficult to extract any meaningful claims. Therefore, I will return empty for this step.\n\n**Step 3: Format the output as a list of claims**\n\nSince there are no extracted entities and no associated claims, my output is:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, if I were to extract some information from the text (keeping in mind that it's still not clear), I could provide an example like this:\n\n(##) None<|>None<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>类及其组成，工作原理和应用范围，以及安装架设等基础知识。\"抢沙发\"，为丽...\n\nBut again, please note that this is a very rough and incomplete extraction.\n\n**Step 4: Return the output in English as a single list of all claims**\n\nSince there are no meaningful claims to extract, my final output remains:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nIf you'd like me to reprocess the input with a clearer understanding or more context about the text, I can try again!", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

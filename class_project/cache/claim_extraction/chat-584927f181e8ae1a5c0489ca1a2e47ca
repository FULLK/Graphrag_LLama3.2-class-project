{"result": "I will guide you through the process of extracting entities and claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract all named entities that belong to these categories.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None (although there are mentions of \"您们\" which means \"you\", it's not a specific person entity)\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there is one mention that could be related to an event: \"两年来\"\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with the entities**\n\nSince we didn't find any named entities that match the specification, we'll move on to extracting claims.\n\nThe claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\" We can interpret this as looking for any statements or assertions in the text that might be useful for information discovery.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I found one potential claim:\n\n* Claim: None of the extracted entities match the specification, but there is a mention of \"两年来\" which could be related to an event.\n* Subject: None\n* Object: None\n* Claim Type: None\n* Claim Status: **SUSPECTED** (since we didn't find any concrete evidence)\n* Claim Description: The text mentions \"两年来\", which could indicate a period of time. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine what this event is.\n* Claim Date: None\n* Claim Source Text: \"你们辛苦了！感谢您们两年来教育之恩！ \"\n\nSince we didn't find any concrete claims or entities that match the specification, our output will be empty.\n\n**Step 3: Format the claim**\n\nSince there are no claims to format, our output will simply be:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, I can provide a formatted version of the extracted text for completeness' sake:\n\n( NONE <|> NONE <|> NO CLAIMS FOUND <|> SUSPECTED <|> 2023-03-07T00:00:00 <|> 2023-03-07T00:00:00 <|> The text mentions \"两年来\", which could indicate a period of time.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

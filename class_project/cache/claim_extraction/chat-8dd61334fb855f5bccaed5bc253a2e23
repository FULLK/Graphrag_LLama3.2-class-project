{"result": "I will extract the entities and claims from the given text document according to the provided entity specification and claim description.\n\n**Step 1: Extracting entities**\n\nThe entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. I will look for these types of entities in the text.\n\nFrom the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, I did find some words that could be related to these entity types. For example:\n\n* \"学生\" (students) could be considered a 'person' entity\n* \"课程教学团队\" (course teaching team) could be considered an 'organization' entity\n* \"激发学生学习兴趣\" (stimulating students' interest in learning) could be related to an 'event' or activity\n\nBut these entities are not explicitly mentioned in the text, and I will not extract them as they are not clear.\n\n**Step 2: Extracting claims**\n\nThe claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\".\n\nFrom the text, I found the following claim:\n\n* Claim Type: None (no specific type of claim)\n* Subject Entity: None\n* Object Entity: None\n* Claim Status: None\n\nHowever, I did find some sentences that could be related to claims or facts. For example:\n\n* \"激发学生学习兴趣，掌握图像处理技能，提高学生综合应用能力\" (stimulating students' interest in learning, mastering image processing skills, and improving students' comprehensive application ability) This sentence describes a goal or objective of the course, but it is not a claim.\n\n**Step 3: Extracting specific claims**\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found two potential claims:\n\n1. \"课程教学团队欢迎您的到来\" (the course teaching team welcomes your arrival)\n\nThis could be considered a claim about the organization or event of the course, but it is not clear what exactly is being claimed.\n\n2. \"激发学生学习兴趣，掌握图像处理技能，提高学生综合应用能力\" (stimulating students' interest in learning, mastering image processing skills, and improving students' comprehensive application ability)\n\nThis sentence describes a goal or objective of the course, but it is not a claim.\n\nHowever, I will extract one potential claim:\n\n* Subject Entity: None\n* Object Entity: None\n", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

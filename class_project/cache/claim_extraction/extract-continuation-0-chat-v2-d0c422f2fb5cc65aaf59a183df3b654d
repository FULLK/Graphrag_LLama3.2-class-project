Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

But it's not a specific entity mentioned in the text.\n* \"医生\" translates to \"doctor\" or \"physician\", which is a type of person.\n\nSince no specific organizations, people, or geographic locations are mentioned directly in the first sentence, we'll move on to the second part of the text:\n\n* organization: None found directly in this sentence either.\n* person: None found directly in this sentence either.\n* geo: None found directly in this sentence either.\n* event: None found directly in this sentence either.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection again, there is a mention of \"评价：医生\" which translates to \"Evaluation: Doctor\". This could be related to an event or an activity. Let's consider it as a potential entity type for now.\n\n\nSince no specific organizations, people, or geographic locations are mentioned directly in the text, we'll focus on extracting claims against entities that match our specification.\n\nThe only possible claim here is about \"医生\" (Doctor), but since there's no concrete information to base a claim on, I won't create one for this scenario.\n\n\nBut wait! There's nothing else mentioned in the text. Given that there are no specific organizations or people mentioned directly in the provided text, and considering the limited context of the sentence, we can consider \"学\" (study) as an entity type.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n* organization: None found directly in the text.\n* person: None found directly in the text.\n* geo: None found directly in the text.\n* event: \"评价：医生\" translates to \"Evaluation: Doctor\", which could be considered a type of activity or event.\n\n\nSince no specific organizations, people, or geographic locations are mentioned directly in the text, we'll focus on extracting claims against entities that match our specification.\n\nHowever, there is an implicit entity here -"}]}

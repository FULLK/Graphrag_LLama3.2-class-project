{"result": "I'll use the provided real data as input for my answer. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n**Step 1:** Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification.\n\nEntity specification: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\n\nText: 提升观众音乐专业素养和欣赏水平。\",,,,,,\n\"评价：这种形式对我们在职教师是最佳的培\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: \"提升观众音乐专业素养和欣赏水平\" (not an event, but a statement)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I notice that there are some Chinese characters in the text. Assuming these characters represent names or locations, I can extract:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: Still none\n\nBut wait! Let me re-examine the text again.\n\nUpon a more thorough analysis, I find:\n\n* organization: None (no clear organizations mentioned)\n* person: None (no clear individuals mentioned)\n* geo: None (no geographical locations mentioned)\n* event: \"在职教师\" (a phrase that could refer to an event or a program)\n\nHowever, this is still not sufficient. Let me try again.\n\nUpon re-examining the text once more, I find:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: Still none\n\nBut then, I notice that \"在职教师\" can be translated to \"in-service teachers\", which could refer to a group of people. However, this is not an event.\n\nHowever, the text mentions \"最佳的培\", which translates to \"best training\". This phrase could potentially refer to an event or program.\n\nBut wait! I have one more chance!\n\nUpon reviewing the text again, I find:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: Still none\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I notice that the text mentions \"评价：这种形式对我们在职教师是最佳的培\". The word \"评价\" translates to \"evaluation\", which could refer to an event or assessment.\n\nFinally!\n\nI can extract:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: \"最佳的培\" (best training) and \"评价\" (evaluation)\n\n**Step 2", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

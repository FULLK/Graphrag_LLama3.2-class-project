However, for this exercise, I'll assume that \"event\" refers to specific instances of time or occurrences.)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I can identify a few relevant entities:\n\n* \"力拓\" (Ernst & Young) - This is an organization, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the entity specification.\n* None of the other entities match the specified types.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no matching entities for the specified types, I will proceed to extract general information that could be relevant to information discovery:\n\nNone\n\nHowever, one phrase stands out as potentially interesting:\n\n\"...培养自己其他方面的能力，广泛的涉猎其他学科的知识...\"\n\nTranslated to English: \"...cultivate other aspects of one's ability, and extensively explore knowledge from other disciplines...\"\n\nThis phrase implies that the person (who is not explicitly mentioned) is interested in learning new things.\n\n**Step 3: Extract claim information**\n\nSince there are no explicit claims or entities matching the specified types, I will create a single claim based on the extracted phrase:\n\n* Subject: None\n* Object: None\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Description: The person is interested in learning new things and exploring knowledge from other disciplines.\n* Claim Date: NONE (Date unknown)\n* Claim Source Text: \"...培养自己其他方面的能力，广泛的涉猎其他学科的知识...\"\n\n**Step 4: Format the claim**\n\n(COMPANY A<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION_DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>\"...培养自己其他方面的能力，广泛的涉猘者其他学科的知识...\")\n\n\nNote that I had to use \"COMPANY A\" as the subject, but it's not a real company in this context.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

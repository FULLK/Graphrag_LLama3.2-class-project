{"result": "I'll guide you through the process of extracting entities and claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extracting entities**\n\nBased on the entity specification `['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']`, I will extract all named entities that match these types. However, since the provided text does not contain any organizations, people, or geographical locations, I will only find an event type.\n\n* Event: 请加入我们的课程吧，由全国\n\n**Step 2: Extracting claims**\n\nFor each entity identified in Step 1, I will extract all claims associated with the entity. Since there is only one entity, I will focus on extracting claims related to it.\n\n* Entity: Event - 请加入我们的课程吧，由全国\n* Claim Description: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n* Text: �不到它是否有用。但总有人告诉我们数学无所不在、无所不用，真是这样吗？请加入我们的课程吧，由全国\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I found no specific claims or facts that directly relate to the event. However, there is a phrase \"数学无所不在、无所不用\" which can be translated to \"mathematics is omnipresent and omnipotent.\" This phrase could be considered as a claim related to mathematics.\n\n* Subject: EVENT\n* Object: NONE\n* Claim Type: MATHEMATICS_ABILITY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Description: The text suggests that mathematics is omnipresent and omnipotent, but this claim is not explicitly stated.\n* Claim Date: NONE\n* Claim Source Text: \"数学无所不在、无所不用\"\n\n**Step 3: Formatting claims**\n\nSince there is only one claim, I will format it as follows:\n\n(EVENT<|>NONE<|>MATHEMATICS_ABILITY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>\"数学无所不在、无所不用\"<|>\"数学无所不在、无所不用\")\n\n**Step 4: Returning output**\n\nThe final output will be:\n\n(EVENT<|>NONE<|>MATHEMATICS_ABILITY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>\"数学无所不在、无所不用\"<|>\"数学无所不在、无所不用\")\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

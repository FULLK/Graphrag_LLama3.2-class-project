However, I can extract 'geo' as '现代社会' (modern society) and '航空、航天' (aviation and aerospace) do not contain exact geo locations but '领域' could be considered as a general concept of location. But more specific geo entities are not found.\nHowever, I did find that the text mentions '电子技术' which can be related to an organization like '电子技术协会' or other organizations but it's not explicitly mentioned in the text.\n\nStep 2:\nFor each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Since no specific entities were found, I will move to Step 3 and return an empty list of claims.\n\nHowever, considering that the text mentions various domains like '航空、航天', '手机和电器' which could be related to organizations or events, I can attempt to extract some information:\n\n* Aviation and aerospace are mentioned, so we might have a claim about an event (e.g. an incident) related to this domain.\n* There's no specific entity extracted, but the text mentions that electronic technology has penetrated various domains, which could be related to organizations or events.\n\nStep 3:\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n\nSince there are no entities extracted in step 1, I will create a list of claims based on the provided text and entity specification. However, please note that these claims might not exactly match the required format as they do not have specific subjects, objects or dates.\n\nClaim 1:\nSubject: NONE\nObject: NONE\nClaim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\nClaim Status: SUSPECTED\nClaim Description: Electronic technology has penetrated various domains.\nClaim Date: NONE\n\n<|NONE|><|NONE|>INFORMATION_DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

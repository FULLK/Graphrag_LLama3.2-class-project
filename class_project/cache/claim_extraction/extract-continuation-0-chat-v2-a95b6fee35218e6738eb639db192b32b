Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It seems to be an educational program.\n* There is no direct mention of organizations or people, but the context suggests that the course might be related to some organizations or events.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no explicit entities matching the specification, I will proceed to extract claims based on the general claim description \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\".\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I found a few relevant statements:\n\n* \"将拥有丰富的电子技术实验技能，不断地探索电子世界\" (translated: \"Will have rich electronic technology experimental skills, constantly exploring the electronic world\")\n* \"评价：电工实验课能够帮�\" (translated: \"Evaluation: Electricity Experiment Course can help\")\n\nThese statements seem to be related to the course's goals and potential benefits. However, I couldn't find any explicit claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim**\n\nSince there are no explicit entities matching the specification, I will format a single claim based on the general claim description:\n\n* Subject: none (no specific entity)\n* Object: none (no specific object)\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Description: The Electricity Experiment Course seems to have some relevance to information discovery.\n* Claim Date: none (unknown)\n* Claim Source Text: \"将拥有丰富的电子技术实验技能，不断地探索电子世界\", \"评价：电工实验课能够帮�\"\n\n**Step 4: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nSince there are no explicit entities matching the specification, I will return a single claim:\n\n(<none><|>NONE<|>INFORMATION_DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>"}]}

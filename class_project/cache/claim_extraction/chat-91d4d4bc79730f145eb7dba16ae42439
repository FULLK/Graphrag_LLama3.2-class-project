But, I do find some implicit information.\n\nThe course is described as \"太棒了\", which can be translated to \"too good\" or \"excellent\". This might imply a positive sentiment towards the course.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no explicit entities that match the specification, I'll focus on extracting claims related to the implicit information mentioned earlier.\n\nI find two relevant pieces of text:\n\n1. \"评价：这个课程简直太棒了\" - This can be translated to \"evaluation: this course is simply too good\".\n2. \"\" - This appears to be a review or feedback about the course, but it's not explicitly stated what makes the course excellent.\n\n**Step 3: Extract claim information**\n\nBased on the extracted claims, I'll fill in the required fields:\n\n1. Subject: None (no explicit entity mentioned)\n2. Object: None (no explicit object mentioned)\n3. Claim Type: COURSE_QUALITY\n4. Claim Status: SUSPECTED (since it's based on implicit sentiment analysis)\n5. Claim Description: The course is considered excellent, but the reasons are not explicitly stated.\n6.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

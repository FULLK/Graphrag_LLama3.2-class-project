{"result": "I'll guide you through the process of extracting claims from the provided text document.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nFrom the input, we have an entity specification of `['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']`. We will extract all named entities that match these types.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I found the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nHowever, there is a mention of \"国家级一流在线本科课程\" which translates to \"national-level first-class online undergraduate courses\". It seems like this could be an organization or institution. Let's extract it as an organization.\n\n**Entity:** 国家级一流在线本科课程 (National-level First-Class Online Undergraduate Courses)\n\nSince there are no other entities that match the specification, we will proceed with extracting claims related to this entity.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nWe have a single entity, and our claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery\". We will look for sentences in the text that contain information about this entity.\n\nThe only sentence related to the entity is:\n\n\"带着这些问题，让我们一起走进国家级一流在线本科课程-口\"\n\nThis sentence does not seem to convey any specific claims or facts, but rather an introduction to a topic. However, it mentions \"国家级一流在线本科课程\", which could be related to some information discovery.\n\nSince there are no specific claims or facts mentioned in the text, we will return **NONE** for each claim field.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(None<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>None<|>带着这些问题，让我们一起走进国家级一流在线本科课程-口)\n## \n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nPlease note that the output is empty because there are no specific claims or facts mentioned in the text related to the entity. If you would like me to analyze further, please provide more context or clarify what information you would like to extract.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

For example, \"农业昆虫\" (agricultural insects) could be related to a geographic location or an event.\n\n**Step 2: Extract all claims associated with each entity and format them as required**\n\nSince there are no explicit claims against specific entities, I will look for any relevant information that could be used to create claims. From the text:\n\n* \"两位老师\" (Two teachers) - There is no direct claim or fact about these teachers being involved in anything suspicious.\n* \"农业昆虫\" (agricultural insects) - This term is mentioned, but there are no specific facts or claims that could be extracted.\n\nHowever, I can create some hypothetical claims based on the information provided:\n\n* Claim 1: Subject - TWO TEACHERS\nObject - NONE\nClaim Type - SUSPECTED\nClaim Status - SUSPECTED\nClaim Description - None\nClaim Date - NONE\nClaim Source Text - None\n\nSince there are no specific facts or claims about these teachers, I will mark this claim as suspected.\n\n**Step 3: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(TWO TEACHERS<|>NONE<|>SUSPECTED CLAIMS<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>None<|><|COMPLETE|>\n\nHowever, this output does not meet the required format. I will reformat it according to the specifications:\n\n(TWO TEACHERS<|>NONE<|>SUSPECTED CLAIMS<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>No claims or facts found about these teachers<|>None)\n## \n\nNote: Since there are no specific claims or facts,", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

However, it seems to refer to a course or program)\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: none\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I can extract some potential entities:\n\n* organization: 门课程 (can be translated to \"course gate\" or \"program gateway\")\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: none\n\nBut actually, the text mentions \"六个教学研究案例\", which means \"six teaching research cases\". So I can extract:\n\n* organization: none\n* person: none\n* geo: none\n* event: six teaching research cases (note: this is not an exact match for a specific event, but rather a collection of events)\n\nStep 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\n\nFrom the text, I can extract the following claims:\n\n* Claim 1:\n\t+ Subject: 门课程 (Course Gate/Program Gateway)\n\t+ Object: none\n\t+ Claim Type: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: This course introduces six common teaching research problems through a comprehensive analysis of six teaching research cases.\n\t+ Claim Source Text: 门课程中，我们将通过对六个教学研究案例的全面解剖分析，介绍六种常见教学研究问题可以\n\n* Claim 2:\n\t+ Subject: 六个教学研究案例 (Six Teaching Research Cases)\n\t+ Object: none\n\t+ Claim Type: EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: This program analyzes six teaching research cases to introduce six common teaching research problems.\n\t+ Claim Source", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

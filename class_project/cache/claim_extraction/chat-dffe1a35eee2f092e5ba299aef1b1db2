{"result": "I'll extract the entities and claims from the given text based on the entity specification and claim description.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities**\n\nFrom the text, I extracted the following named entities that match the entity specification:\n\n* organization: None (no clear organizations mentioned)\n* person: None (no clear individuals mentioned)\n* geo: None (no geographic locations mentioned)\n* event: None (no specific events mentioned)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I found a few mentions of entities that could be related to information discovery:\n\n* \"临床实践\" (clinical practice) - This is an organization or concept related to healthcare, which falls under the category of \"organization\".\n* None other relevant entities were found.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims**\n\nFor each entity identified in Step 1, I extracted all claims associated with the entity. Since there are no clear individuals, organizations, geographic locations, or specific events mentioned in the text, I'll focus on extracting any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nFrom the text, I found a few sentences that mention something related to information discovery:\n\n* \"述，事无巨细，让我感到很贴近我们的现实生活，对我们为以后进入临床实践具有不可忽略的\"\n* This sentence doesn't contain any clear claims or facts. It seems to be discussing the importance of considering all aspects and relevance in clinical practice.\n\nHowever, another part of the text mentions:\n\n* \"对我们为以后进入临床实践具有不可忽略的\" (has an undeniable significance for our future entry into clinical practice)\n\nThis sentence implies that there is some information or knowledge that is crucial for success in clinical practice. I'll extract a claim based on this:\n\n**Claim 1:**\n\n* Subject: None\n* Object: **NONE**\n* Claim Type: INFORMATION_DISCOVERY\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n* Claim Description: There is significant information relevant to future entry into clinical practice.\n* Claim Date: **NONE**\n* Claim Source Text: \"对我们为以后进入临床实践具有不可忽略的\"\n\n**Step 3-4: Format and return output**\n\nSince there are no clear entities or claims extracted, I'll return an empty list. However, based on the provided text, I can still extract a single claim that might be relevant to information discovery.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n##", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

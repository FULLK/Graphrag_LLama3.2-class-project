Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

It also mentions \"广告人\" which translates to \"advertising person\" or \"advertiser\". But again, no explicit mention of organizations.\n\nHowever, I did find some relevant information:\n* \"业界大咖的独家专访\" can be translated to a conversation with industry experts.\n* \"帮助专业学生成为优秀广告人\" translates to helping professional students become excellent advertisers.\n\nBut still no direct match for any entity type specified in the problem statement.

This statement can be interpreted as a claim about the benefit of some service or program for advertising professionals.\n\nWe also have another relevant piece of information:\n* \"好听的广告音乐\" translates to nice-sounding advertisement music, but it doesn't seem like it's directly related to any claims.\n\nHowever, there is one more statement that seems relevant:\n* \"帮助普通人\" translates to helping ordinary people.

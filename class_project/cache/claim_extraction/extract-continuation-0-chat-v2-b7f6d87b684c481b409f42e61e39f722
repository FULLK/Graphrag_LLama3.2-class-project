Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The text contains no explicit mentions of organizations or events, but it does contain a mention of \"业余爱好者\" which can be translated to \"hobbyist\" or \"amateur\", and \"在线上\" which means \"online\". However, these are not exact matches for the entity types specified.\n\nThe only potential match is the word \"课程\" (course) which could potentially refer to an event or a type of organization. But since it's not explicitly clear what kind of course this is referring to, I will disregard it as a named entity.\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.**\n\nSince no entities were found that match the specified types, there are no claims to extract.\n\n**However**, upon closer inspection of the text, we can see some potential information discovery relevant claims:\n\n* The course is for \"不识乐谱、不懂音乐的业余爱好者\" which translates to \"those who do not read sheet music and do not understand music\". This could be a claim about the target audience.\n* The course is described as an \"在线上轻松学唱歌\" which translates to \"online easy singing course\". This could be a claim about the nature of the course.\n\n**Step 3: Extract relevant information for each claim.**\n\nFor the first potential claim, we can extract the following:\n\n* Subject: **NONE** (no explicit subject mentioned)\n* Object: **NONE** (no explicit object mentioned)\n* Claim Type: TARGET_AUDIENCE\n* Claim Status: **TRUE**\n* Claim Description: The course is designed for those who do not read sheet music and do not understand music.\n* Claim Date: **NONE**\n* Claim Source Text: \"适用于不识乐谱、不懂音乐的业余爱好者作为入门课程，在线上轻松学唱歌。\"\n\nFor the second potential claim, we can extract the following:\n\n* Subject: **NONE** (no explicit subject mentioned)\n* Object: **NONE** (no explicit object mentioned)\n* Claim Type: COURSE_DESCRIPTION\n* Claim Status: **TRUE**\n* Claim Description"}]}

Although not explicitly mentioned as an organization or person, it can be considered as an event or a concept related to rail technology. For the purpose of this exercise, I will extract it as an entity.\n\n**Claim Extraction**\n\nSince there are no explicit claims or facts in the text that match the specified claim description, I will focus on extracting relevant information that could be useful for information discovery.\n\n* Entity: **高速铁路信号技术**\n\t+ Subject: **NONE** (no specific subject mentioned)\n\t+ Object: **NONE** (no object mentioned)\n\t+ Claim Type: **GENERAL INFORMATION**\n\t+ Claim Status: **TRUE**\n\t+ Claim Description: The text provides general information about the course, which covers the basic methods, theories, and system structure of high-speed rail signal technology.\n\t+ Claim Date: **NONE** (no specific date mentioned)\n\t+ Claim Source Text: The entire text is relevant to this claim.\n\nOutput:\n\n(高速铁路信号技术<|>NONE<|>GENERAL INFORMATION<|>TRUE<|>None<|>None<|>The text provides general information about the course, which covers the basic methods, theories, and system structure of high-speed rail signal technology.<|>专业课，学生可以通过学习该课程来了解、掌握高速铁路信号技术的基本方法、基本理论与系统结构。\")\n\n**Complete**\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

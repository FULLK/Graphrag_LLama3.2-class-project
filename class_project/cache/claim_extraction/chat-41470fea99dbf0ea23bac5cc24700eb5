{"result": "I'll follow the steps you provided to extract claims from the given text. Here's my output:\n\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification.\n\nFrom the text, I can identify the following entities:\n- organization: None (no organizations mentioned in this short text snippet)\n- person: None\n- geo: None\n- event: 1946年第一台计算机面世 (1946 - the year the first computer was introduced)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.\n\nFrom the identified entities, I can only extract a claim related to the \"event\" entity:\n- Event: 1946年第一台计算机面世\n\n3. Extract the following information for each claim:\n\n- Subject: name of the event that is subject of the claim, capitalized.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized (in this case, none).\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. Since we are only extracting facts and there's no judgment involved in this context, I'll use **TRUE** for all claims.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFor the event \"1946年第一台计算机面世\", I have:\n\n* Subject: 1946 YEAR THE FIRST COMPUTER WAS INTRODUCED\n* Object: NONE\n* Claim Type: COMPUTING HISTORY\n* Claim Status: TRUE\n* Claim Description: This is a historical fact about the introduction of the first computer.\n* Claim Date: 1946-01-01T00:00:00 | 1946-12-31T23:59:59\n* Claim Source Text: 概述：1946年第一台计算机面世之后，科学家与工程师们一直致力于让计算机更好地为人类工作，一代\n\n4. Format each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

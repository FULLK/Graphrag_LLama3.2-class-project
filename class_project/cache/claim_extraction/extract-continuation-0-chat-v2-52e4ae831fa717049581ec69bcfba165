Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Here is my approach:\n\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification from the given text document.\n\nIn this case, the entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. However, upon examining the input text, it appears to be in Chinese, which might make it difficult to extract entities directly. But I will attempt to identify relevant entities:\n\n* \"大学\" can be translated to \"University\", which could be considered an organization.\n* \"徐敏教授\" translates to \"Professor Xu Min\", which is a person.\n\nNo geo or event entities are mentioned in the text.\n\n2. For each entity identified, extract all claims associated with the entity that match the specified claim description.\n\nThe claim description is \"Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\" This means I will look for any statements or phrases that convey some kind of fact or assertion about the entities found.\n\nFor \"University\" (organization) and \"Professor Xu Min\" (person), there are no direct claims made in the text. However, since we're looking at a description of an online course taught by Professor Xu Min, it could be argued that there is information relevant to discovery:\n\n- The fact that Professor Xu Min leads this course.\n- That it's a national-level online gold course.\n\n3. For each claim extracted, format the information as specified:\n\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made.

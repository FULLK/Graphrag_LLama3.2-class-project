{"result": "I'll follow the steps to extract the required claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nFrom the input text, I can identify the following named entities that match the entity specification:\n\n* organization: None (no explicit mention of an organization)\n* person: None (no explicit mention of a person)\n* geo: China (implied by \"中国共产党\" and \"20届3中全会\")\n* event: 20大报告, 20届3中全会 (two events mentioned in the text)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that there are no specific entities mentioned in the text that match the entity specification. The text appears to be a passage of philosophical or ideological content.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no explicit named entities matching the specification, I will assume the task is to extract any relevant information or facts from the text.\n\nUpon analyzing the text, I can identify some general statements that might be relevant to information discovery:\n\n* \"出的实践品格与问题意识，是我们认识世界的强大武器\" - This sentence implies a connection between practice and problem-solving awareness in understanding the world.\n* \"根据中国共产党20大报告及20届3中全会...\" - This sentence mentions two specific events or reports, but without more context, it's difficult to extract meaningful claims.\n\nHowever, I can try to extract some general claims based on these statements:\n\n1.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

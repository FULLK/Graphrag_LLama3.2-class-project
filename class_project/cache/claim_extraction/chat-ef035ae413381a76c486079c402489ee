Let's try to extract more entities from the text.\n\nUpon re-reading the text, I can also extract:\n\n* organization: 理论知识应用于实践活动中 (Theory Knowledge Application in Practical Activities)\n\nSo, the updated list of extracted entities is:\n\n* organization: 理论知识应用于实践活动中 (Theory Knowledge Application in Practical Activities)\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None\n\nStep 2: Extracting claims for each entity\n\nFor the entity \"理论知识应用于实践活动中\" (Theory Knowledge Application in Practical Activities), I can extract the following claim:\n\nClaim Type: INFORMATION DISCOVERY\nClaim Status: TRUE\nClaim Description: Theory knowledge is applied to practical activities.\nClaim Date: **NONE**\nClaim Source Text: 理论知识应用于实践活动中，把所学知识转化为动手能力、应用能力和创造能力，力求理论和实践的\n\nHowever, this claim does not meet the condition of having a specific organization or person as its subject.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

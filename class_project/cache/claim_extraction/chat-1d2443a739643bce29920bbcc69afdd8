{"result": "Based on the provided text and entity specification, I will extract the claims as per the given steps.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nFrom the text, I extracted the following entities:\n\n* organization: None (no clear mention of a specific organization)\n* person: None (no clear mention of a specific person)\n* geo: China (implied by the context, but not explicitly mentioned as a geo entity)\n* event: None (no clear mention of a specific event)\n\nHowever, I did find some relevant information:\n\n* The text mentions \"国家级一流本科\" which could be translated to \"National-level first-class undergraduate course\", implying that the institution is a university or college.\n\n**Step 2: Extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nSince there are no clear matches for the specified entities, I will focus on extracting relevant information related to the context of the text.\n\n* The text mentions \"跨界竞争成为商业常态\" which translates to \"cross-border competition becomes a business norm\". This could be interpreted as a claim about the changing business landscape.\n* The text also mentions \"商业模式的重要性日益显现\" which translates to \"the importance of business models is becoming increasingly evident\".\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as per the required format**\n\nSince there are no clear matches for the specified entities, I will create a single claim based on the extracted information.\n\n* Subject: **CHINA** (implied by the context)\n* Object: **NONE**\n* Claim Type: **BUSINESS LANDSCAPE CHANGE**\n* Claim Status: **SUSPECTED**\n* Claim Description: The business landscape is changing with cross-border competition becoming a norm, and the importance of business models is becoming increasingly evident.\n* Claim Date: **NONE** (unknown)\n* Claim Source Text: 题，当跨界竞争成为商业常态，商业模式的重要性日益显现。本课程获评首批国家级一流本科\n\n**Step 4: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(CHINA<|>NONE<|>BUSINESS LANDSCAPE CHANGE<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The business landscape is changing with cross-border competition becoming a norm, and the importance of business models is becoming increasingly evident.<|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

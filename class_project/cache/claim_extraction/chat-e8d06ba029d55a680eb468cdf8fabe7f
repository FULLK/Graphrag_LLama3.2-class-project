{"result": "I will follow the steps to extract entities and claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extract named entities that match the entity specification**\n\nFrom the input text, I can identify the following entities:\n\n* organization: None\n* person: None\n* geo: None\n* event: None (Note: There are no events mentioned in the text)\n\nHowever, there is a mention of \"高等数学\" which can be translated to \"Higher Mathematics\", but it's not clear if it's an entity or just a subject. Since we don't have any specific information about this topic, I will assume it's not an entity.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with the entities**\n\nSince there are no entities that match the specification, there are no claims to extract.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the text, I can identify some relevant information:\n\n* \"会解基本的常微分方程\" which translates to \"can solve basic ordinary differential equations\"\n* \"为后续课程的学习奠定基础\" which translates to \"lays a foundation for subsequent courses\"\n\nThese phrases could be related to claims or facts about mathematics, but they don't directly match the entity specification. If I were to extract claims based on relevance, I might extract:\n\n* Claim 1: Mathematics is essential for solving basic ordinary differential equations. (Subject: None, Object: None, Claim Type: MATHEMATICS, Claim Status: TRUE, Claim Description: ..., Claim Date: UNKNOWN, Claim Source Text: ...)\n* Claim 2: Higher mathematics courses build upon previous knowledge of ordinary differential equations. (Subject: None, Object: None, Claim Type: EDUCATION, Claim Status: TRUE, Claim Description: ..., Claim Date: UNKNOWN, Claim Source Text: ...)\n\nHowever, these claims do not match the format specified in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as per the specified format**\n\nSince there are no entities that match the specification, and I couldn't extract any relevant claims, the output will be empty.\n\n**Step 4: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nThe output is:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that this is not an error message, but rather a signal to indicate that there are no more claims to process.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.
